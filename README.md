# Skim
Displays condensed news articles written in the past month using the News API. Tap on the left and right arrow icons to navigate through different articles. Tap on the newspaper icon to open the full article. Whenever the application is opened, a random collection of articles will be available for the user to navigate through. Use the search bar to search for articles related to a certain topic. Entering multiple words will make the search more specific, resulting in articles related to multiple topics. If an article is too long to fully fit on the screen or if the keyboard is open, the user will be able to scroll through the content. Error messages will be displayed if a search yields no results or if there is an issue with the network connection. If the internet disconnects after a successful search, the user will still be able to navigate through the articles because they were saved immediately after the search.
